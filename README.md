# Payroll Webserver

A Kotlin Spring Boot web application that includes functionalities.

### Small Logic Tasks
Included in the same project with standalone controller:
#### Endpoints:
- GET /api/logiceee/starrings/{value}
a recursive method where identical chars that are adjacent in the original string will be separated by a "*".

- GET /api/logiceee/verify/{email}
a method that accepts a string and checks if this is a valid email address

### Implementation

#### Database
I used Spring Data JPA, which is part of the larger Spring Data family, makes it easy to easily implement JPA based repositories. This module deals with enhanced support for JPA based data access layers. It makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies.

#### Web 
Spring Boot offers a fast way to build applications. It looks at your classpath and at the beans you have configured, makes reasonable assumptions about what you are missing, and adds those items. With Spring Boot, you can focus more on business features and less on infrastructure.

#### Payroll Calculator
An interface that contains a calculate method and has two concrete implementations for Fixed and Monthly Members

- Logic Tasks(not related to payroll)
